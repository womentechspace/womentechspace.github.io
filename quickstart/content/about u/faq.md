Do I need to know anything about websites or programming?
No! Workshops are for beginners. You don’t need to know anything about it. However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS are) you still can apply!

Should I bring my own laptop?

Yes. We have no hardware, so we expect you to bring your computer with you.

In the event that you cannot get your hands on a laptop, please get in touch as we do have links to a local community group that can help out! It is also important for us that you will take home everything you’ll write and create during workshops.

Do I need to have something installed on my laptop?

It would be helpful to have Django installed before workshop. Take a stab at installing, but if you struggle, don't worry! We'll help you on the day. We will also be available the evening before to help you install. Installation instructions are here.

Is food provided?

Yes. Snacks and lunch will be served during the workshop.

Is there going to be an exam or test?

No! Our aim is to introduce you to the world of programming and technology in an environment where you'll feel safe to learn and explore at your own pace.

Are Django Girls workshops only for females?

No! All genders can apply. We don't want to get men out of programming; we just want to bring more women in.

Participants need to follow the Django Girls Code of Conduct.
