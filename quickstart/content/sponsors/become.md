Become a sponsor!
We couldn't be here without the support from amazing people and organizations who donated money, knowledge and time to help us make this a reality

We have met some super people around Northern Ireland.

You are all awesome!

If you would like to become a sponsor or just get involved in any way, please get in touch.

Email us at: belfast@djangogirls.org and we can grab a coffee!
