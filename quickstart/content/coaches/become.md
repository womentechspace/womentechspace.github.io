We would be delighted if you would like to join us as a coach!<br />

You don't have to have been a coach before and we love previous attendees to return as coaches and mentor some of our newcomers. Don't worry if you think you don't have enough knowledge. We are all still learning and coaches will help each other out!

Coach submissions are open. Click [here](http://bit.ly/WTSFeb18Coach) to become a Django Girls coach.

We will contact you, but if you'd like to know what is happening with your submission, you can contact us by [email](mailto:womentechspace@gmail.com).
