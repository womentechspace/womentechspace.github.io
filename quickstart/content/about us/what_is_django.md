Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

If you are a beginner, this framework provides you with most of the tools and setup required to get a site up and running with minimal fuss. It is a very good starting point to be productive without worrying about complicated configuration. Once you get used to Django, you can move on to other languages and/or frameworks.

You can find more information about the Django framework [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
