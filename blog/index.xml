      <description>The first ever Women Tech Space is scheduled for Monday 25th September 2017 at the Ormeau Baths gallery. We are sold out and we are hoping that we get 30 women full of motivation and drive to learn!
Women Tech Space was in discussion for a long time. I have been involved with Django Girls Belfast for a while now and each workshop becomes a little better, a little bit smoother, more relaxed and a lot of fun.</description>
