      <description>We would be delighted if you would like to join us as a coach!
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have been a coach before and we love previous attendees to return as coaches and mentor some of our newcomers. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you think you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge. We are all still learning and coaches will help each other out!
Coach submissions are open. Click here to become a Django Girls coach.</description>
