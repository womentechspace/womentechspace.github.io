      <description>Do I need to know anything about websites or programming?
No! Workshops are for beginners. You don’t need to know anything about it. However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS are) you still can apply!
Should I bring my own laptop?
Yes. We have no hardware, so we expect you to bring your computer with you.
In the event that you cannot get your hands on a laptop, please get in touch as we do have links to a local community group that can help out!</description>

      <description>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
If you are a beginner, this framework provides you with most of the tools and setup required to get a site up and running with minimal fuss.</description>
