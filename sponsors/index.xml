      <description>Puppet have been our sponsor from 2017 and have been incredibly supportive in getting our workshops up and running, providing an amazing space to work from and supplying us with food.
We could not have done it without them! A huge thanks to you (especially Christine!) :)
  June 2018 workshop   Puppet also co-hosted the sold-out Women Tech Space Christmas Party in 2017 which was a huge hit with all the children who attended.</description>
